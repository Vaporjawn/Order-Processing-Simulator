- Your program should give each order a unique identifier when it is created
- Your program will create the orders and then process them in the order they were created. Sequential number is acceptable for unique order identifier.
- Your program should somehow display the orders completed by each order processor along with the elapsed time to process that order
- After all orders are processed the program should output the number of orders processed by each processor and the average time to complete orders for that processor
